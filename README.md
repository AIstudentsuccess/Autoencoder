Required Files
To run the code successfully, ensure you have the following files in the same directory as the script:

sample_data.csv: The sample dataset.
zip_code_coordinates.csv: The zip code coordinates dataset.
country_and_state_coordinates.csv: The country coordinates dataset.

Note:
The dataset included in this repository is a synthetic sample created solely for demonstration and testing purposes. It has been fully randomized and contains no real student information. The column structure matches the original dataset used in our Student Success project, but the sample data were not used in the research and carry no analytical value.
All outputs (e.g., those generated by the convolutional autoencoder) in this repository reflect results based on this sample data, not actual student records.
This approach ensures compliance with university data security and privacy policies.
